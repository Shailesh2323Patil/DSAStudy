Que 1 : Implement Stack using Array
Problem Statement:  Implement a stack using an array.
Level : Easy
Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/implement-stack-using-array/

Example :
// Image

Explanation:
push(): Insert the element in the stack.
pop(): Remove and return the topmost element of the stack.
top(): Return the topmost element of the stack
size(): Return the number of remaining elements in the stack.

Solution

Intuition: As we know stack works on the principle of last in first out, so we have to put elements in an
array such that it keeps track of the most recently inserted element. Hence we can think of using a Top
variable which will help in keeping track of recent elements inserted in the array.

Approach:

* Declare an array of particular size.
* Define a variable “Top” and initialize it as -1.
* push(x): insert element is the array by increasing top by one.
* pop(): check whether top is not equal to -1 if it is so, return top and decrease its value by one.
* size(): return top+1.

public class StackUsingArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack s = new Stack();
        s.push(6);
        s.push(3);
        s.push(7);
        System.out.println("Top of the stack before deleting any element " + s.top());
        System.out.println("Size of the stack before deleting any element " + s.size());
        System.out.println("The element deleted is " + s.pop());
        System.out.println("Size of the stack after deleting an element " + s.size());
        System.out.println("Top of the stack after deleting an element " + s.top());
    }
}

public class Stack {
    int size = 10000;

    int top = -1;
    int[] array = new int[size];

    public void push(int data) {
        top++;
        array[top] = data;
    }

    public int pop() {
        int x = array[top];
        top--;
        return x;
    }

    public int top() {
        return array[top];
    }

    public int size() {
        return top + 1;
    }
}

Output :
Top of the stack before deleting any element 7
Size of the stack before deleting any element 3
The element deleted is 7
Size of the stack after deleting an element 2
Top of the stack after deleting an element 3

Time Complexity: O(N)

Que 2 : Implement Queue Using Array
Problem Statement:   Implement Queue Data Structure using Array with all functions like pop, push, top, size, etc.
Level : Easy
Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/implement-queue-using-array/

Example :
Input: push(4)
       push(14)
       push(24)
       push(34)
       top()
       size()
       pop()

Output:

The element pushed is 4
The element pushed is 14
The element pushed is 24
The element pushed is 34
The peek of the queue before deleting any element 4
The size of the queue before deletion 4
The first element to be deleted 4
The peek of the queue after deleting an element 14
The size of the queue after deleting an element 3

Solution :

Intuition:

The intuition is to fill the array in a circular manner, (ie) after popping from the front, rather than moving all
the elements towards the front. We can have 2 variables to keep track of the start and end indexes of the sequence.
Mod addition is done to handle boundary conditions.


Approach:

The basic approach is to maintain two variables to point to the START and END of the filled elements in the
array. START pointer is used to point to the starting index of the elements and the same case for the END
pointer(ending index). Initially, both have value -1(indicating empty queue).

First, let’s see the implementation of the push function. Push basically inserts a new element at the end.
So only the END variable is going to be incremented.

Corner case 1: What if we have no empty places in the array? So, first check that, if we don’t have we exit,
in the other case we increment the START variable and put the new element.

Corner case 2: What if END reaches the last index? We are doing mod with addition. So, END goes back to index 0([0-(n-1)]
will always be the range for END).

Second, let us see the pop function. In Queue pop removes and returns the front element. So, START needs to be modified.
The general approach is to copy the current element pointed by START and increase the START variable to the next index.

Corner case 3: What if the Queue is empty? That’s why we are checking the START variable. If it is -1, then the queue
is empty, we just exit.

Corner case 4: What if START goes out of bound? As done for END, mod addition comes to the rescue.

Corner case 5: What happens after popping the last element? We check this state with the currSize variable. Queue returns
to the initial state, both START and END are set to -1.

Third, let’s see the top function. It behaves more like a pop function. We need to return the element pointed by the START
variable. Since we are not actually removing any element, it’s fine to ignore corner cases 4 and 5.

That’s all about the Queue class implementation. In the main function, we just initialize the Queue class to check all
corner cases.

Program :

public class QueueUsingArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue q = new Queue(4);
        q.push(4);
        q.push(14);
        q.push(24);
        q.push(34);
        System.out.println("The peek of the queue before deleting any element " + q.top());
        System.out.println("The size of the queue before deletion " + q.size());
        System.out.println("The first element to be deleted " + q.pop());
        System.out.println("The peek of the queue after deleting an element " + q.top());
        System.out.println("The size of the queue after deleting an element " + q.size());
    }
}

public class Queue {
    private int[] arr;
    private int start, end, currSize, maxSize;

    public Queue() {
        arr = new int[16];
        start = -1;
        end = -1;
        currSize = 0;
        maxSize = 16;
    }

    public Queue(int maxSize) {
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
        arr = new int[maxSize];
        start = -1;
        end = -1;
        currSize = 0;
    }

    public void push(int data) {
        if(currSize == maxSize) {
            System.out.println("Queue is Full\nExiting");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        if(end == -1) {
            start = 0;
            end = 0;
        }
        else {
            end = (end + 1) % maxSize;
        }

        arr[end] = data;
        System.out.println("The element you pushed is : "+data);

        currSize++;
    }

    public int pop() {
        if(currSize == 0) {
            System.out.println("Queue is Empty\nExiting");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        int data = arr[start];
        if(currSize == 1) {
            start = -1;
            end = -1;
        }
        else {
            start = (start + 1) % maxSize;
        }

        currSize--;
        return data;
    }

    public int top() {
        if(currSize == 0) {
            System.out.println("Queue is Empty\nExiting");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        return arr[start];
    }

    public int size() {
        return currSize;
    }
}

Output :
The element you pushed is : 4
The element you pushed is : 14
The element you pushed is : 24
The element you pushed is : 34
The peek of the queue before deleting any element 4
The size of the queue before deletion 4
The first element to be deleted 4
The peek of the queue after deleting an element 14
The size of the queue after deleting an element 3

Que 3 : Implement Stack using single Queue
Problem Statement:  Implement a Stack using a single Queue.
Level : Easy
Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/implement-stack-using-single-queue/

Note: Stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) rule.
Note: Queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule.

Example:

// Image

Solution:

Intuition: As we know stack follows last in first out, which means we get the most recently inserted
element whenever we remove an element from the stack. But queue follows first in first out, it means we
get that element which we inserted in the starting at each deletion, it means if we want to use the queue
like a stack we have to arrange elements in the queue such that we get the most recent element at each deletion.

Approach:

* Take a single queue.
* push(x): Push the element in the queue.
* Use a for loop of size()-1, remove element from queue and again push back to the queue, hence the most recent
  element becomes the most former element and vice versa.
* pop(): remove the element from the queue.
* top(): show the element at the top of the queue.
* size(): size of the current queue.

// Image

Program :

public class StackUsingQueue {
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StackUsingQueue s = new StackUsingQueue();
        s.push(3);
        s.push(2);
        s.push(4);
        s.push(1);
        System.out.println("Top of the stack: " + s.top());
        System.out.println("Size of the stack before removing element: " + s.size());
        System.out.println("The deleted element is: " + s.pop());
        System.out.println("Top of the stack after removing element: " + s.top());
        System.out.println("Size of the stack after removing element: " + s.size());
    }

    public void push(int data) {
        queue.add(data);
        for (int i = 0; i < queue.size() - 1; i++) {
            queue.add(queue.remove());
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        return queue.poll();
    }

    public int top() {
        return queue.peek();
    }

    public int size() {
        return queue.size();
    }
}

Output :
Top of the stack: 1
Size of the stack before removing element: 4
The deleted element is: 1
Top of the stack after removing element: 4
Size of the stack after removing element: 3

Time Complexity: O(N)

                    Queue using the given Stack?
Level : Easy

Queue: A Queue is a linear data structure that works on the basis of FIFO(First in First out).
This means the element added at first will be removed first from the Queue.

size() operation is for returning the size of a queue which can be done by using the function Stack1.
size(). It will actually return the total number of elements in the queue.

public class QueueUsingStack {
    private Stack<Integer> input = new Stack<Integer>();
    private Stack<Integer> output = new Stack<Integer>();

    public void push(int data) {
        while (input.empty() == false) {
            output.push(input.pop());
        }

        System.out.println("The element pushed is " + data);
        input.push(data);

        System.out.println("The top element is " + q.peek());
        System.out.println("The size of the queue is " + q.size());

Que 5 : Check for Balanced Parentheses
Problem Statement:  Check Balanced Parentheses. Given string str containing just the characters ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘ and ‘]’, check if the input string is valid and return true if the string is balanced otherwise return false.
                    Note: string str is valid if:
                    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
                    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Level : Easy
Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/check-for-balanced-parentheses/

Example 1:
Input: str = “( )[ { } ( ) ]”
Output: True

Explanation: As every open bracket has its corresponding
close bracket. Match parentheses are in correct order
hence they are balanced.

Example 2:
Input: str = “[ ( )”
Output: False

Explanation: As ‘[‘ does not have ‘]’ hence it is
not valid and will return false.

Solution

Intuition:  We have to keep track of previous as well as most recent opening brackets and also keep in mind the sequence,
as after opening of the bracket there should be opposite pairs of brackets. Also handle the corner cases like [ ) ( ]
where closing bracket occurs first and opening bracket after it, which is an invalid sequence, as well as [ ( ] )
where the most recent opening didn’t get its opposite pair hence it will also not be valid.

So we have to use a data structure that will keep track of first in and last out, hence we will use the stack.

Approach:

* Whenever we get the opening bracket we will push it into the stack. I.e ‘{‘, ’[’, ’(‘.
* Whenever we get the closing bracket we will check if the stack is non-empty or not.
* If the stack is empty we will return false, else if it is nonempty then we will check if the topmost element of the
stack is the opposite pair of the closing bracket or not.
* If it is not the opposite pair of the closing bracket then return false, else move ahead.
* After we move out of the string the stack has to be empty if it is non-empty then return it as invalid else it is a
valid string.

Program :

public class CheckedForBalancedParentheses {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s="()[{}()]";
        if(isValid(s)==true) {
            System.out.println("True");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("False");
        }
    }

    public static boolean isValid(String str) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();

        for (Character it : str.toCharArray()) {
            if(it == '{' || it == '(' || it == '[') {
                stack.push(it);
            }
            else {
                if(stack.empty()) {
                    return false;
                }
                Character last = stack.pop();

                if( it == '}' && last == '{'
                    || it == ')' && last == '('
                    || it == ']' && last == '[')
                {
                    continue;
                }

                return false;
            }
        }

        return stack.empty();
    }
}

Output :
True

Que 6 : Next Greater Element Using Stack
Problem Statement:  Given a circular integer array A, return the next greater element for every
element in A. The next greater element for an element x is the first element greater than x that
we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner. If it doesn’t exist, return -1
for this element.
Level : Easy
Link : https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/next-greater-element-using-stack/

Example 1:

Input: N = 11, A[] = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9}
Output: 10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10
Explanation: For the first element in A ,i.e, 3, the greater element which comes next to it while traversing and
is closest to it is 10. Hence,10 is present on index 0 in the resultant array. Now for the second element,i.e, 10,
there is no greater number and hence -1 is it’s next greater element (NGE). Similarly, we got the NGEs for all other
elements present in A.

Example 2:
Input:  N = 6, A[] = {5,7,1,7,6,0}
Output: 7,-1,7,-1,7,5

Solution

Approach:

This problem can be solved easily and efficiently by using the stack data structure as it is based on
the Last in First out (LIFO) principle.

To make it a bit easier let’s first try to solve without considering the array as circular. To find the
next greater element we start traversing the given array from the right. As for the rightmost element,
there is no other element at its right. Hence, we assign -1 at its index in the resultant array. Since
this can be the next greater element (NGE) for some other element, we push it in the stack S. We keep
checking for other elements. Let’s say we are checking for an element at index i. We keep popping from
the stack until the element at the top of the stack is smaller than A[i]. The main intuition behind popping
them is that these elements can never be the NGE for any element present at the left of A[i] because A[i]
is greater than these elements. Now, if the top element of S is greater than A[i] then this is NGE of A[i]
and we will assign it to res[i], where res is the resultant array. If the stack becomes empty then it implies
that no element at the right of A[i] is greater than it and we assign -1. At last, we push A[i] in S.

Dry run: Let’s apply this algorithm for A[] = {5,7,1,2,6,0}:

// Image

So, the resultant array is {7,-1,2,6,-1,-1}. Remember that we have considered the array to be non-circular.
For a circular array, the resultant array should be {7,-1,2,6,7,5}.

Now we need to make this algorithm work for a circular array. The only difference between a circular and non-circular
array is that while searching for the next greater element in a non-circular array we don’t consider the elements
left to the concerned element. This can be easily done by inserting the elements of the array A at the end of A,
thus making its size double. But we actually don’t require any extra space. We can just traverse the array twice.
We actually run a loop 2*N times, where N is the size of the given array.

Program :

public class NextGreaterElementTUF {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[]={5,7,1,2,6,0};

        int arr2[] = nextGreaterElements(arr);
        System.out.println("The next greater elements are ");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr2[i] + " ");
        }
    }

    public static int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] nge = new int[nums.length];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 2 * n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (stack.empty() == false && stack.peek() <= nums[i % n]) {
                stack.pop();
            }

            if(i < n) {
                if(stack.empty() == false) {
                    nge[i] = stack.peek();
                }
                else {
                    nge[i] = -1;
                }
            }

            stack.push(nums[i % n]);
        }

        return nge;
    }
}


Output :
The next greater elements are
7 -1 2 6 7 5

Next Greater Element I
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of
nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

Brute Force :
-------------

Approach:
There are two common approaches to solve this problem:

Brute Force Approach
The brute force approach is straightforward. For each element in nums1, iterate through nums2 to find the matching element.
Once we find the matching element, iterate through the remaining elements in nums2 to find the next greater element. If we
find a greater element, update the max variable. Finally, add max to the answer vector.

public class NextGreaterElementLeetCodeBruteForce {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[]={4,1,2};
        int arr2[]={1,3,4,2};

        int ans[] = nextGreaterElements(arr, arr2);
        System.out.println("The next greater elements are ");
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(ans[i] + " ");
        }
    }

    public static int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] num1, int[] num2) {
        int max = -1;

        int ans[] = new int[num1.length];

        for(int i = 0; i < num1.length; i++)
        {
            max = -1;
            for (int j = 0; j < num2.length; j++)
            {
                int index = j;
                if(num1[i] == num2[j]) {
                     while (index < num2.length) {
                         if(num2[index] > num1[i]) {
                             max = num2[index];
                             break;
                         }
                         index++;
                     }
                }
            }
            ans[i] = max;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

Output :
The next greater elements are
-1 3 -1

Using stack with map
The second approach uses a stack and a map. We traverse nums2 and push each element onto the stack. If the current element is
greater than the top element of the stack, we pop elements from the stack and add them to the map with the current element as
the value. Once we finish traversing nums2, we iterate through nums1 and check if each element has a next greater element in
the map. If it has, we update the element in nums1 with the corresponding value in the map. Otherwise, we update the element
in nums1 with -1.

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Stack;

public class NextGreaterElementLeetCodeOptimalApproach {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        int arr[]={4,1,2};
//        int arr2[]={1,3,4,2};

        int arr[]={1,3,5,2,4};
        int arr2[]={6,5,4,3,2,1,7};

        int ans[] = nextGreaterElements(arr, arr2);
        System.out.println("The next greater elements are ");
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(ans[i] + " ");
        }
    }

    public static int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] num1, int[] num2) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for(int num : num2) {
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.peek() < num) {
                hashMap.put(stack.pop(), num);
            }
            stack.push(num);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < num1.length; i++) {
            num1[i] = hashMap.containsKey(num1[i]) ? hashMap.get(num1[i]) : -1;
        }

        return num1;
    }
}

Output :
The next greater elements are
7 7 7 7 7

Complexity:
Time Complexity:
Approach 1: Brute Force Approach
For each element in nums1, we iterate through nums2. So, the time complexity is O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of nums1
and nums2, respectively.
Approach 2: Using stack with map
We traverse nums2 once and push each element onto the stack. So, the time complexity of this step is O(m).
For each element in nums1, we check if it has a next greater element in the map. The time complexity of this step is O(n).
So, the overall time complexity is O(n+m).

Space Complexity:
Approach 1: Brute Force Approach
We use an answer vector to store the next greater elements. So, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of nums1.
Approach 2: Using stack with map
We use a stack to store the elements and a map to store the next greater elements. So, the space complexity is O(m+n), where
m and n are the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
